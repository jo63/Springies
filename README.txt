Team Members: Kevin Oh (jo63) & Ryan Fishel (ref13)
Date started: part 2: Jan 25 part 3: Feb 8
Date completed: part 2: Feb 6 part 3: Feb 17 

Each Member role: 
Ryan: Worked on implementing the MouseAction, WallRepulsion, Force, Viscosity, Muscle classes, modifying the Canvas class and commenting + checkstyling. 25+ hours contributed
Kevin: Worked on implementing Controller, KeyAction, factory package, different WallRepulsion subclasses, CenterOfMass, Gravity, FixedMass, Physics and modifying the Model class and commenting + checkstyling 30+ hours contributed

The Main.java can be found in the default package. 
File choice order: the first file to be read is the environment.xsp (should you want a physics environment) which contains the values of the physics forces. The second file to be read is the example.xsp which holds specifications on the various sprites to be displayed on the canvas. The assembly.xsp file is for loading an additional assembly by pressing "n" once the program is running. 

There is currently an issue with the getBounce() method in the mass class where the masses are having difficulty when bouncing off the walls. They are sometimes thrown off the canvas. 

For the future, I wish that there was a better tutorial on how to use github before we start the project as there were many hours spent on trying to resolve merge conflicts and detached heads.
